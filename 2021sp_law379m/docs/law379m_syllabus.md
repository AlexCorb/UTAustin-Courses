# Overview

This course is ONLINE only.

In this course, we will learn about introductory concepts related to
modern cybersecurity. Unfortunately, these concepts are 
so broad that we will only be scratching the surface of a *subset* of 
available sub-topics, principles, and applications. The goal, however, is
to introduce law and policy students to foundational technology concepts
that will be helpful to them throughout their careers.

# University-mandated Disclosures

## Safety and Class Participation/Masks
We will all need to make some adjustments in order to benefit from 
in-person classroom interactions in a safe and healthy manner. Our best 
protections against spreading COVID-19 on campus are masks (defined as cloth 
face coverings) and staying home if you are showing symptoms. Therefore, 
for the benefit of everyone, this is means that all students are required 
to follow these important rules. 

1. Every student must wear a cloth face-covering properly in class and in 
all campus buildings at all times. 
1. Students are encouraged to participate in documented daily symptom screening.  
This means that each class day in which on-campus activities occur, students must 
upload certification from the symptom tracking app and confirm that they completed 
their symptom screening for that day to Canvas.  Students should not 
upload the results of that screening, just the certificate that they completed it. 
If the symptom tracking app recommends that the student isolate rather than 
coming to class, then students must not return to class until cleared by a medical professional.
1. Information regarding [safety protocols with and without symptoms](https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/coronavirus_exposure_action_chart.html) 
can be [found here](https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/coronavirus_exposure_action_chart.html).

If a student is not wearing a cloth face-covering properly in the classroom (or any UT building), that student must leave the classroom (and building). If the student refuses to wear a cloth face covering, class will be dismissed for the remainder of the period, and the student will be subject to disciplinary action as set forth in the university’s Institutional Rules/General Conduct 11-404(a)(3). Students who have a condition that precludes the wearing of a cloth face covering must follow the procedures for obtaining an accommodation working with Services for Students with Disabilities.

## Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited
No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, 
videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), 
in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online 
or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my explicit, written permission. 
Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the 
University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. I am well aware 
of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are 
associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be 
reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of 
Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course. 

## Class Recordings
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes 
and are protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class 
in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student 
Misconduct proceedings.

## COVID Caveats
To help keep everyone at UT and in our community safe, it is critical that 
students report COVID-19 symptoms and testing, regardless of test results, to 
University Health Services, and faculty and staff report to the HealthPoint Occupational 
Health Program (OHP) as soon as possible. Please see this link to understand what 
needs to be reported.  In addition, to help understand what to do if a fellow student 
in the class (or the instructor) tests positive for COVID, see this 
[University Health Services link](https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/coronavirus_exposure_action_chart.html).

# Expectations

## Prerequisites

There are no technical pre-req's for this course. The professor assumes that
most of you will have had little to no technical background.

We will do lab projects in this course, but they will be "guided tours," meaning
that much of the labwork will be provided as a framework, giving you an 
opportunity to explore and get your hands dirty without a full understanding
of all the technical nitty-gritty.

## Major Course Goals

This course is roughly divided into two modules:

1. Constructive: what cybersecurity properties are, why they matter, 
and how they are enforced.
1. Destructive: the concepts, including theoretical concepts, behind computer 
security failures, why they are difficult to overcome, and how attackers use
these to bypass the enforcement mechanisms used in the Modern world.

As an introductory course, there is an immense amount of breadth required.
It should come as no surprise that the labwork cannot possibly cover all
of this breadth. We will be using a textbook this semester to expose you
to cybersecurity principles.

*MAJOR DISCLAIMER:* The professor does NOT like the book. It has out-of-date
information, overly simplistic explanations, and a host of other problems. There is not,
as yet, a good Network Security and Privacy book available (in the Professor's opinion).
This book was chosen because it touches on a reasonably wide range of principles
in a reasonably sufficient depth of technical discussion. We will use the book
as a starting point for learning, but that is all.

### Constructive Concepts

By the end of the course, students are expected to understand the basic concepts
behind constructing a secure network and ensuring privacy. The concepts we will
focus on in class are:

1. What are security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity?
1. What are some basic concepts of enforcing security properties such as authentication and authorization?
1. What is the role of cryptography in enforcing security properties?
1. What is the role of secure protocols in enforcing security properties?
1. What is the role of monitoring traffic in enforcing security properties?

### Destructive Concepts

By the end of the course, students are expected to understand the basic concepts
behind failures in network security and privacy technologies that result in the
destruction (violation) of intended security policies. The concepts we will focus
on in class are:

1. What is a vulnerability, what is an exploit, and what is a compromise of a security property?
1. How does computer science theory, such as the Halting Problem, impact the nature of failures?
1. What are software vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow vulnerabilities?
1. What are cryptographic vulnerabilities?
1. What are protocol and application vulnerabilities, such as web and database vulnerabilities?
1. What principles of secure design can help in mitigating vulnerabilities, exploits, and compromises?
1. What is the role of intrusion detection in mitigating vulnerabilities, exploits, and compromises?

# Course Policies

## Subject-to-Change
This is the instructor's first semester teaching this course. Please
be patient with the changes that will certainly come as we go along.

Many portions of this syllabus were derived from the professor's other
network security course. There may be errors. If you find any, please
report them.

## Attendance

Attending lectures and keeping up with the readings is crucial 
for success in this class. Even though we will be remote, please attend
class in real-time in order to engage in discussion and group learning.


## Office Hours
Your instructor is an adjunct faculty; that means he is not on campus
regularly and does not have an office. Unless you specifically request
an in-person meeting, all office hours will be remote.

## Textbook and Readings
The textbook for this course, terrible though it may be, is "Security in Computing" by Pfleeger.

We will occasionally make reference to the following book that 
is freely available online:

[Ross Anderson, Security Engineering 2nd ed.](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html)


You are REQUIRED as part of the course to read assigned sections of the textbook,
additional references, and assigned paper.

To evaluate your reading, you are required to meet
with a group of other students on a weekly basis in some kind of chatroom.
You can use Zoom for this, but leave the video off and just use the chat feature.
The meeting should be about twenty minutes and involve no more than five students.
When finished, you will submit a transcript of the chat to me for grading. You will be scored
based on your participation in the 20-minute discussion.

Your score is NOT dependent on UNDERSTANDING the material. Your score is dependent on
having read the material and efforts made to understand it. For example, if you read
something that you didn't understand, your score during the discussion might be based
on the insightful questions that you ask your peers or references to other online
sources (even Wikipedia) that you used to try and get a better grasp of the concept.

If you struggle to participate in groups like this for any reason (English is your second
language, social anxiety, time pressure, etc.), please contact the professor to work
out a solution.

## Programming Projects
There will be five projects.

Each project will be, in any ways, a "guided tour." You will
need to acquire the professor's code/modules for each project
that will walk you through the rest of the lab.

Different labs will permit different levels of collaboration.
Please make sure that you understand what is and is not
permitted for each lab and ask if you have any questions.

## Exams

There will be two in-class, midterm exams. The professor
is still figuring out how to test the remote students and more
information will be forthcoming.

The exams will be exclusively ESSAY QUESTIONS, but will have
no restrictions related to referring to the book, notes, or
even the Internet. The only restriction will be that you may
not talk to another human being (classmates, roommates, etc).
The exam will also be strictly timed. There will be a hard
deadline for submission after which there will be immediate
deductions in grades, so it is ideal to try to finish the
exam early and submit early in order to ensure that transmission
delays and other issues don't cause you to lose points.

The scoring for exam will NOT focus on your writing skills, grammar,
spelling, etc. Instead, each question will require you to 
build explanations, arguments, or narratives based around technical
concepts you have learned. We will score your essay on the 
correct application of these technical concepts to the question.

Any indication of cheating, such as copying another students
answers, collaborating with another student, communicating with
another human about the test questions, etc. will result in an
automatic 0 on the exam and a full grade deduction (A to B, B+ to C+, etc.).

## Grading

* Labs are strictly Pass/Fail. 12% each (60%)
* Reading discussions (10%)
* Exams. 15% each. (30%)
* 2 Possible extra credit projects.
* Cheating is an automatic fail.

Because labs are pass fail, we will provide various mechanisms
for verifying that your lab is correct before submission, such
as an auto-grader. We will be autograding all assignments.

Given the pass/fail nature of projects, you may resubmit with
no penalty any time before the due date. That is, you may 
submit, receive a score, and then re-submit any time before the 
due date for a new auto-score.

You may request, exactly once, a regrade of a programming project within two
days of receiving your score. You request will be granted 
so long as it is clear that you had a functional project and you are not
simply using this as a two-week extension. The professor has the final
say as to whether the regrade is allowed.

In order to make life reasonable for the professor who will be grading
your submissions, you must complete all labwork within five
school days of the due date. Each date late is a 20% penalty.

You may submit any one lab at the last day of class for 80% credit.
The two week period before this has no labwork assigned, and is
designated as a "make up" period. In other words, you can catch-up,
or re-do, any lab of your choosing during this two week period for
80% credit.
